API REST for audio reproducing, it is a very simple API REST for MPD
(Music player DAEMON). If you want a good web player for you RPI REST, take a look at the project: https://github.com/notandy/ympd

At the moment, the API is useful if you want to reproduce some sound,
alarm or advice from your web IoT's solutions.

Keep in mind that you have to install and configure MPD in the Raspberry.
